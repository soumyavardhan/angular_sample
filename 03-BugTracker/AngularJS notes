AngularJS notes

sudo npm install http-server -g
sudo npm install -g json-server


view should not know anything about the model apart from the necessary.
A model can have multiple views
all views must be synced using events on view as well as model change (Angular does this be itself)


Angular JS
Angular expects the user to change models with the knowledge of the score object

to let the scope object know, we have a function called $apply() #helps keep track of changes to view in the model
to track an object we have a function called $watch() #helps keep track of changes in the model in the view

angular.bootstrap(document.body, [])
var scope = angular.element(document.body).scope();

scope.name = ''
scope.$watch('name', function() {
	
})

scope.$apply(function(){
	make changes here
})

Building blocks of Angular JS
1.) Scope
2.) Module
3.) Controller
4.) Directive - connect scope with DOM
5.) Filter - Transforms data for presentation purposes
6.) Factory
7.) Service
8.) Value
9.) Constant
10.) Providers


Nested scopes to avoid name collisions and to maintain data access across scopes

on all divs that need a scope, we will use a directive ng-controller
every scope object has a function called $new that creates a new scope with the first scope as a parent
<div ng-controller="function"> #this function should be present in the module


Query By Example - using a product to search among products (Filter allows doing this, helps when we want to search only on name and not on fixed status)



Server Communication:
Promise Object - irrespective of when the async operation is completed, I will be able to get the result from an object that I need to subscribe to. This object is called the Promise object. Promise object holds the result of the async operation and I can subscribe to it even after the event is completed and still get the result.
